What is mixin ?

In object-oriented programming languages, a mixin is a class that contains methods for use by other classes without having to be the parent class of those other classes. How those other classes gain access to the mixin's methods depends on the language. Mixins are sometimes described as being "included" rather than "inherited".

Example : 

class LoggingMixin(object):
    """
    Convenience super-class to have a logger configured with the class name
    """

    @property
    def logger(self):
        try:
            return self._logger
        except AttributeError:
            self._logger = logging.root.getChild(self.__class__.__module__ + '.' +self.__class__.__name__)
            return self._logger
